This is an invoicing app that allows users to sort upcoming deliveries by days of the week (using Active Support's datetime methods) or by undelivered. A user can sign for the invoice using a Javascript signature pad that tracks HTML5 cursor drag, and can export the invoice to PDF format using Prawn.

### Each row lights up when hovered, and acts as a link. Sign For is a unique link:
